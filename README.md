# Description
NB_SVM_model.sav and vectorizer.sav were trained on the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classifcation Challenge dataset for the purpose of classifying toxic messages. Was originally used for filtering messages on Discord, however selfbots on Discord have since been deprecated. Prototype.py is a quick script that allows for testing of the model.
